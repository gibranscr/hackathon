      "IIDENTIFICATION AND USE: Benzene is a clear, colorless liquid with a sweet aromatic odor. It is used mainly as a starting material in manufacturing other chemicals, including detergents, pesticides, plastics and resins, synthetic rubber, aviation fuel, pharmaceuticals, dye, explosives, PCB gasoline, flavors and perfumes, paints and coatings, nylon intermediates, photographic chemicals. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Immediate signs and symptoms of exposure to benzene: People who breathe in high levels of benzene may develop drowsiness, dizziness, rapid or irregular heartbeat, headaches, tremors, confusion unconsciousness, death. Eating foods or drinking beverages containing high levels of benzene can cause vomiting, irritation of the stomach, dizziness, sleepiness, convulsions, rapid or irregular heartbeat, death. Long-term (a year or more) exposure to benzene causes harmful effects on the bone marrow, resulting in anemia and excessive bleeding. It can also affect the immune system, increasing the chance for infection. Some women who breathed high levels of benzene for many months had irregular menstrual periods and a decrease in the size of their ovaries. Acute deaths from benzene exposure at high concentrations have been due to ventricular fibrillation caused by exertion and release of epinephrine. Benzene causes cancer in humans. A retrospective cohort study was conducted in 233 benzene factories and 83 control factories in 12 cities in China. The benzene cohort and the control cohort consisted of 28,460 benzene exposed workers and 28,257 control workers. The leukemia mortality rate was 14/100,000 person-years in the benzene cohort and 2/100,000 person-years in the control cohort. Most (76.6%) cases of benzene leukemia were of the acute type. The mortality due to benzene leukemia was high in organic synthesis plants followed by painting and rubber synthesis industries. The concentration of benzene to which patients with a leukemia were exposed ranged from 10 to 1000 mg/cu m (mostly from 50 to 500 mg/cu m). Benzene is genotoxic in humans: a significantly increased frequency of chromatid and isochromatid breaks in the cultured lymphocytes of exposed workers has been reported, as well as a significant increase of peripheral blood lymphocyte chromosomal aberrations. Metabolic activation of benzene by rat liver microsomes  induced sister chromatid exchanges and cell division delays in cultured human lymphocytes. Occupational exposure to benzene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact. The general population may be exposed to benzene via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with consumer products containing benzene. ANIMAL TOXICITY STUDIES: Experimental animal studies, both inhalation and oral, also support the evidence that exposure to benzene increases the risk of cancer in multiple organ systems, including the hematopoietic system, oral and nasal cavities, liver, forestomach, preputial gland, lung, ovary, and mammary gland. Rats exposed to 3,526-8,224 ppm of benzene in a closed chamber for 15 minutes exhibited an increased number of ectopic ventricular beats. In developmental study, rats exposed to 10, 50, or 500 ppm (32, 160 & 1600 mg/cu m) of benzene for 7 hr/day had low incidence of brain and skeletal defects. Rats exposed continuously to 209.7 ppm for 10 days prior to breeding showed a complete absence of pregnancy. 1/10 rats exposed to 19.8 ppm had resorbed embryos. Genotoxicity studies have demonstrated the induction of chromosomal aberrations in bone-marrow cells from mice, rats, and rabbits treated with single or multiple daily doses of benzene ranging from about 0.2 to 2.0 mL/kg per day given either sc or ip. The major metabolites of benzene are phenol, hydroquinone, and catechol. The route of exposure has little effect on the subsequent metabolism of benzene to hemotoxic metabolites. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: Young Coho salmon mortality was 12/20 at 50 ppm after 24 hr up to 96 hr and 30/30 at 100 ppm after 24 hr in artificial seawater at 8 Â°C. Herring and anchovy larvae studies showed that 35-45 ppm caused delay in development of eggs and produced abnormal larvae; 10-35 ppm caused delay in development of larvae, decrease in feeding  and growth, and increase in respiration. Blue crab juveniles when exposed to sublethal concentrations of benzene (0.1 or 5.0 ppm) in a static system showed an increase in the time needed to complete a molt cycle (50 days in case of benzene-exposed crab, as compared to 33 days for controls), a slower rate of growth of regenerating limb buds, and a depressed activity of ATPase in mitochrondria. Oxygen consumption by the crab decreased from exposure to 1.0 ppm benzene.\n",

      "IDENTIFICATION: n-Hexane is a straight chain saturated hydrocarbon obtained from certain petroleum fractions after various thermal or catalytic cracking steps. Commercial hexane may contain from 20%-85& n-Hexane and various amounts of hexane isomer, 2-methylpentane, 3-methylpentane, 2-3-dimethylbutene, cyclopentane, cyclohexane and small quantities of pentane and heptane isomers, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, dichloromethane and trichloroethylene. Trace amounts of benzene may be present. N-Hexane is a colorless liquid and solubility in water is low. It is miscible with alcohol, chloroform and ether. Main uses are: rubber and adhesive solvent in shoe factories; extraction of soybean oil, callous seed oil and flaxseed oil. It is used in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries and is a cleaning agent for textiles, furniture and leather products. N-Hexane is also used for: determination of the refractive index of minerals, filling for thermometers and denaturant. HUMAN EXPOSURE: The target organs are: central nervous system and  peripheral  nervous system, respiratory system, heart, skin and eyes. Chemical pneumonia can occur after ingestion and and aspiration to the lungs. CNS depression, convulsions, coma and death may follow acute exposures to large concentrations. Inhalation of n-hexane usually causes eye, nose, throat and respiratory irritation, which are rapidly reversible when exposure is discontinued. Symptoms are more severe is ingestion or inhalation are associated with exposure to other hydrocarbons which may potentiate the effects. Exogenous catecholamines may precipitate a fatal ventricular arrhythmia in the sensitized myocardium. Acute exposure to considerable concentrations of n-hexane may cause cough, wheezing, bloody frothy sputum, headache, dizziness, tachycardia and fever. Gastrointestinal symptoms may result. Respiratory system: slow and shallow respiration; aspiration of n-hexane may cause pulmonary edema and chemical pneumonia. Cardiovascular system: tachycardia and ventricular dysrhythmia. Central nervous system: vertigo, giddiness, CNS depression syndrome. In heavy exposures unconsciousness may result. Peripheral nervous system: chronic exposure may produce important peripheral neuropathy (motor sensory) and CNS abnormalities. Gastrointestinal tract: nausea, vomiting and anorexia. Adults may be exposed in the workplace or in case of suicide attempts. Glue sniffing or n-hexane sniffing puts individuals at risk. There is a potential for accidental ingestion may occur in children. Laboratory workers which use the solvent for extraction procedures, chemists and pharmacists may be exposed. In the factory, glues and adhesives industry employees and those in printing and painting occupations. N-Hexane is absorbed following inhalation, ingestion or by topical application to the skin. In human volunteers about 28% of inhaled n-Hexane was taken up by the lungs. Alveolar retention is about 25% of the inhaled dose of n-hexane and the final absorption is 15%-17% in relation to the total respiratory uptake. Alveolar uptake was greater in obese individuals. Although the alveolar uptake rate decreased during physical exercise, the total uptake of n-hexane increased slightly as a result of the higher lung ventilation rate. Concentrations of n-hexane correlated with blood concentrations in industrial workers exposed to commercial hexane. It is poorly absorbed by the gastrointestinal system. Dermal absorption is very slow. Peak blood levels occur in less than 1 hour following inhalation or percutaneous exposure. N-Hexane has great affinity for high lipid content tissues and is rapidly metabolized to hydroxylated compounds before being converted to 2,5-hexanedione. The respiratory elimination of n-hexane in recently exposed workers was biphasic. The median half-lives of the fast and slow phases were 11minutes and 99 minutes. Workers exposed to n-hexane for about 7 hours/day without protective devices had the following metabolites in the urine: 2-hexanol, 2-methyl-2-pentanol, 3-methyl-2-pentanol, cyclohexanol, cyclohexane and trichloroethanol. In humans exposed to concentrations of up to 200 ppm, steady state blood levels were dose dependent; accumulation occurred in humans exposed to as little as 1 ppm. ANIMAL STUDIES: At the first step of oxidative metabolism   by cytochrome p-450, the carbons 1,2,3 of n-hexane molecule are hydroxylated and form hexanols in different proportions in all species of animals. N-Hexane is metabolized  by mixed function oxidase system in the liver forming alcohols which are conjugated to glucuronic acid or converted to carbon monoxide. 1-Hexanol and 3-hexonal are less toxic  metabolites. The former is oxidized to hexanoic acid which undergoes the usual lipid metabolism. 2,5-Hexanedione was detected in urine. In rats exposed to n-hexane, important alterations in the quantity and composition of pulmonary surfactant in rats after short term exposure. The lungs of rats exposed to hexane at different concentrations showed a direct toxic effect on pneumocytes; fatty degeneration, change of alveolar bodies in type 2 pneumocytes and increased detachment of cells. Severe atrophy involving the seminiferous tubules with loss of the nerve growth factor in immunoreactive germ cell line of rats after 61 days of exposure was noted. Permanent testicular damage was found in some animals which had a total loss of the germ cell line lasting up to 14 months after the post exposure period. Simultaneous administration of n-hexane with toluene or xylene did not cause germ cell line alterations or testicular atrophy. In vitro toxicity of n-hexane and 2,5-hexanedione has been evaluated in the isolated perfused rabbit heart. The force of cardiac contraction was significantly reduced following 1 hour of perfusion with n-hexane or 2,5-hexanedione. Spinal neuron cell cultures exposed to n-hexane and butanone developed the neural swelling faster than when exposed to n-hexane. Animal tests have been negative for teratogenic effects. In pregnant rats showed n-hexane blood concentrations in the fetus equal to that found in maternal blood. Isopropanol enhances the induction of n-hexane metabolizing  enzymes and increases the 2-hexanol concentrations in the liver and kidney. Methyl isobutyl ketone mixed with n-hexane significantly increased aniline hydroxylase and cytochrome P450 activity in the liver of exposed hens.\n",
